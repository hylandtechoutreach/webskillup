# Self-Paced Work: Conditional Debugging
One of the most important parts of programming is [debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging) - the process of finding and fixing errors in code. In this activity, practice debugging an existing program. You may not be familiar with these structures yet, but see if you can figure out how to work with them!

Start by testing out the buttons to see how they work. You may notice that each of these buttons has an issue. This is a serious problem. You need to fix all these issues.

All changes should take place in the **script.js** file.

## 1. Clothing Check
This button should tell you what clothes to wear based on the temperature.

- Button name: Clothing Check
- Function name: `clothing`
- Issue: Says to wear a T-shirt if the temperature is below 60 degrees

## 2. Background Change
This button should let you change the background color of the page.

- Button name: Background Change
- Function name: `backgroundChange`
- Issue: Changes the background to the incorrect colors
- _Added Challenge: Rewrite this function so that it does not use `if` statements at all!_

## 3. Evidence of Aliens
This button should show you evidence of extra terrestrials ONLY IF the correct password is entered.

- Button name: Evidence of Extraterrestrial Life
- Function name: `evidence`

- Issue: Says the wrong school level based on ages provided

## 5. MLB Players
