# Lesson 6: Conditionals
This lesson covers conditional statements and boolean values.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to:

- Create `if` statements
- Utilize `else` clauses
- Understand the boolean data type

## Introduction: Video
Show [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wU2NoAtWKM) to introduce the basic idea of boolean logic.

## Debugging Activity
Introduce the [debugging activity](ConditionalDebugging.md), and have the participants attempt to complete it independently. They may not be familiar with these concepts, but hopefully they will still be able to figure out how to fix the issues.

## Booleans Presentation
Present the [Booleans PowerPoint](Booleans.pptx).

## Code-Along: Chatbot
Walk through the [code-along instructions](ChatbotCodeAlong.md) with the participants.

## Self-Paced Work: Readings && Challenges && Games
Give participants time to work on some of the self-paced work, including the [advanced reading](ConditionalReading.md), [logic operators guide](LogicOperators.md), and [challenges](ConditionalChallenges.md).

## Formative Assessment
Have the participants complete the [formative assessment](https://forms.gle/T4bv9UvzrxzsAtCo7). Responses available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WPqpmIyStxJofrF4M9LnO5-jSFoC6g6dUl7-QKhDnBs/edit?usp=sharing).
