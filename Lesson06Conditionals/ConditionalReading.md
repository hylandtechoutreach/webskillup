## More Introductory Resources
The [JAVASCRIPT.INFO] tutorial has some friendlier (but still robust) articles that cover different facets of these topics. Read through these as well:

## Dive Into Types
If you've used a language like Java or C#, you may be comfortable with defining the data types of variables... but JavaScript is a little different. Check out [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures) to get into the nitty gritty of all the different types and coercions that occur in the wonderful world of JavaScript. For even further understanding, read through [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness) to see how all these values can be compared to one another.
