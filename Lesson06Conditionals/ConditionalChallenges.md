# Challenges: Conditionals
Try to complete these challenges to practice using conditionals. These challenges are a mix of difficulty, so feel free to hop around to different ones.

## Twenty Questions Continued
One of the [conditional tests](ConditionalTests.md) challenges involved a simplified version of a [twenty questions game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_questions). Expand this into an actual program that uses `prompt`s to ask questions of the user, and then tries to determine what cartoon animal they are imagining. Fill out the possible guesses to include more cartoon animals as well.

## Quiz
Create a quiz about yourself (or any subject matter). Feel free to use [this](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/QuizAboutMe) as a starting point, or start from a new Repl project. Try to add at least five questions. Questions can be asked through `prompt`s, with the user's answer compared to the correct answer with an `if` statement.

## Choose Your Own Adventure
Create a text-based [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) game with `prompt`s and `if` statements. Or, use buttons and updating variables to do something like [this](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-102/FinalProjects/MonsterAdventure.html).
