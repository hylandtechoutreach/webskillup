# Code-Along: Chatbot
In this activity, create a simple [chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot) that can respond to some basic messages using `if` statements.

## Background
Chatbots have been around for quite a while, but they have grown a lot since their inception.

Start things off by talking to [ELIZA](https://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/eliza.htm), a "Rogerian Therapist" chatbot from the 1960s. This is a small example of what is possible with chatbots. You can [view the source](view-source:https://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/eliza.htm) of the page to dissect the inner workings of the bot... any illusion of "intelligence" may dissipate quickly upon viewing the code.

#### Side-Note: Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)
The definition of "real A.I." has changed quite a bit over the years. At one point in time, the idea of a computer that could play chess was considered outlandishly intelligent... then, [Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Kasparov,_1996,_Game_1), and people began to dismiss this as "[not _real_ intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect)."

When it comes down to it, a lot of A.I. _can_ be boiled down to some number of `if` statements controlling the flow of a program... but with paradigms like neural networks, there is quite a bit more complexity. For example, [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) runs on a [large language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model); no one wrote out `if` statements for every possible input and response.

All this to say, the chatbot created in this activity _will_ be artificially intelligent by some definitions... but to create something like ChatGPT, it would be necessary to use machine learning or something similar.

## Setting Up
For this activity, your job is to make a chatbot that will act as a friend to people who do not have many friends. This will help them feel less lonely.

### The Code
Make sure to note how the code is currently working. The "Chat" button displays a message when it is clicked.

In the **index.html**, the `<button></button>` element has an `onclick` attribute that calls the `talk` function.

In the **script.js** file, the `talk` function is defined - it runs an `alert` to display a pop-up message.

## Part One: Prompt For Message
The first thing to do is ask the user to input a message. This is possible by creating a new variable, and using `prompt`.

1. Open the **script.js** file for editing
1. Make a new line between the `{` and `}`, under the `alert` statement
1. Create a new variable named `message`
1. Set the `message` variable to a `prompt`
1. Make the text for the prompt say "Please enter a message..."

The added JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
let message = prompt("Please enter a message...");
```

Run the code. Click the button, and verify that a prompt appears asking for a message. Nothing should happen when entering a message yet though!

## Part Two: Responding to the Message
Next, the chatbot should respond to certain messages the user enters. This is where `if` statements come in: the response should be different depending on the message.

To start, have the chatbot respond to a message of "Hi" from the user.

1. Open the **script.js** file for editing
1. Make a new line between the `{` and `}`, under the `message` variable
1. There, create an `if` statement
    - Keyword: `if`
    - Parentheses: `()`
    - Curly brackets: `{}`
1. For the `if` condition, check if the user said "Hi"
    - Condition goes between the parentheses
    - Use `message` variable, `===`, and `"Hi"` to compare
1. In the _body_ of the `if`, display a message saying "Well hey there!"
    - Body is between the curly brackets
    - Use `alert("Well hey there!");`

The added JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
if (message === "Hi") {
  alert("Well hey there!");
}
```

Run the code. Click the button, enter "Hi" as the message, and verify that the proper response appears! If any other message is entered, no response should appear.

## Part Three: More Responses
The chatbot is functional, but it is not very powerful yet. It needs to be able to respond to some more messages! Add a couple more responses using `if` statements.

| Message | Response |
|-|-|
| I love you | That's nice |
| Are you my friend? | Yes, of course... |

These `if` statements will look very similar to the previous `if` statement. For each of the responses, follow these steps:

1. Have the **script.js** file open for editing
1. Make a new line at the bottom of the `chat` body (above `}`)
1. Add an `if` statement: `if () {}`
1. For the condition (between `(` and `)`), check if `message ===` the given message
1. In the body (between `{` and `}`), `alert` with the response

The added JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
if (message === "I love you") {
  alert("That's nice");
}

if (message === "Are you my friend?") {
  alert("Yes, of course...");
}
```

Run the code. Click the button, and try out each of the messages. Make sure to enter them exactly right, with proper punctuation/capitalization/etc. Each message should produce the correct response!

## Part Four: A Deeper Conversation
Currently, the chatbot can only handle one message. Update the code so that the conversation can continue depending on what the user enters. This will be possible with _nested_ `if` statements.

1. Make a new line in the body of the `"Are you my friend?"` statement
1. There, `prompt` the user again, this time asking "Are you *my* friend?"
1. Under that, create another `if` structure
1. For the conditional, check if the user entered `"Yes"`
1. In the body of that `if`, display a message of "Okay, good :-)"
1. Under the body, add an `else` structure
1. In the `else`, display a message of ":-("

Run the code, enter the correct chain of messages, and ensure that the conversation proceeds properly! The added code (_nested_ within the other `if`) should look something like this:

```js
let nextMessage = prompt("Are you *my* friend?");
if (nextMessage === "Yes") {
  alert("Okay, good :-)");
} else {
  alert(":-(");
}
```

## Final Code
By the end of the activity, the code in the **script.js** file should look something like this:

```js
function talk() {
  alert("Hi friend ðŸ™‚");

  let message = prompt("Please enter a message...");

  if (message === "Hi") {
    alert("Well hey there!");
  }

  if (message === "I love you") {
    alert("That's nice");
  }

  if (message === "Are you my friend?") {
    alert("Yes, of course...");

    let nextMessage = prompt("Are you *my* friend?");
    if (nextMessage === "Yes") {
      alert("Okay, good :-)");
    } else {
      alert(":-(");
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
After the basic code-along activity has been completed, work on some of these additional features.

### Even More Responses
There is always room for more responses to be added to the chatbot! Come up with some original ones, or use this list as a basis. Each new response should use a similar `if` statement structure:

```js
if (message === "MESSAGE") {
    alert("RESPONSE");
}
```

Add several responses to make the chatbot more lifelike.

| Message | Response |
|-|-|
| What's up? | Not much |
| How are you | I am fine |
| Sing a song | Mary had a little lamb |
| What is 1+1 | 1+1 is 2 |
| Tell me a joke | I'm against picketing, but I don't know how to show it. |
| Give me a quote | You miss 100% of the shots you take |
