# Lesson 7: DOM Manipulation

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to:

- Store HTML elements as JavaScript elements
- Retrieve values from `<input>` elements in JavaScript
- Set text content and attribute content on HTML elements with JavaScript
- Update page styles with JavaScript

## Warm-Up: Static Content
First, show [this video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ZtyMdRzvi0w) to begin. It begs the question - should HTML be written by hand? In reality, most developers write barely any HTML by hand. Most of it is generated dynamically by a framework or an API, such as the DOM API.

Play [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52efG_Mz5SQ) for no reason other than that Dom DeLuise's name is Dom.

>_Note from the author: The first time I taught this lesson, there was a kid who kept asking me "Who is Dom and why are we manipulating him?"_

## Introduction: DOM Manipulation Presentation
Present the [introductory presentation](DomManipulation.pptx).

### Written Guides
Show the written guides as well:

- [Read from Input](DomManipulationReadFromInput.md)
- [Update HTML](DomManipulationUpdateHtml.md)

### Advanced Reading
For experienced participants, there is some [advanced reading](DomReading.md).

## Code-Along: Shopping List
Walk through the [instructions](ShoppingListCodeAlong.md) with the participants to build a simple shopping list website with dynamically updating HTML.

## Self-Paced Work: Challenges
Allow the students to work on the [challenges](DomChallenges.md).

### Inputs
There is a lot more to do with HTML input elements.
