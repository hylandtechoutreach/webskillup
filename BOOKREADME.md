# Web Skillup
Welcome to the Web Skillup program, presented by the Hyland Tech Outreach team!

## Program Overview
This program is designed to cover essential web development concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By the end of day two, all participants should have a solid grasp of the code in [this project](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/WebSkillupMvp).

Given the short time frame, this will be a crash course. The hope is that each participant walks away feeling inspired and empowered to dive deeper into these topics and continue building their web development skills.

Each lesson is equipped with a **ðŸŸ¢ Basic** and an **ðŸ”· Advanced** approach. Any participant, regardless of current knowledge, should be able to find value in this experience by taking one of these approaches.
