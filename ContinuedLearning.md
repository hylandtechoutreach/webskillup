# Continued Learning
These resources can help guide you on your continuing quest to learn web development.

## W3Schools: Approachable & Simple
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is a great resource for beginners. It introduces each topic in a simple way. It is not quite as technical or in-depth as some of the other resources here, but it covers all the important things you'll need to get started.

## JAVASCRIPT.INFO: Friendly but Rigorous
[The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/) is another good way to learn. It gets a little deeper into the technical details than W3Schools does, but it still maintains a friendly and welcoming tone.

## MDN: Technical & Detailed
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) is perhaps the most robust source for web development information on the entire internet. It spares no detail, which can often make it a little more intimidating. However, it is an excellent resource for anyone looking to understand the concepts of web development at a very deep level.

## Questions: Stack Overflow
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) has an answer to almost any web development question you might ask. It can be a little scary to read through some of the responses (a lot of people seem to know _everything_), but being able to navigate the site will come in handy quite a bit.

## ChatGPT
It may seem silly, but [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) knows quite a bit, and it can usually spit out some decent code if you prompt it right. Take everything it says with a grain of salt, but it's great at providing starting points for projects, or giving quick code snippets.
