# Lesson 8: For Loops
This lesson introduces `for` loops as a way to run code iteratively.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to:

- Create `for` loops
- Adjust existing code to use `for` loops
- Understand the power of `for` loops

## Warm-Up: Counter
Have the participants complete the warm-up activity by following [the instructions](WarmUp.md). The idea is to show how annoying it is to repeat code manually.

## Introduction: Reading
Let participants read through the [introductory reading](ForLoopReading.md), or the [advanced reading](https://javascript.info/while-for).

## Formative Assessment: Loop Tracing
Have participants take the [Loop Tracing quiz](https://looptracing.hylandoutreach.repl.co/).

## Code-Along: Library of Babel
Follow the [instructions](BabelCodeAlong.md) to update a webpage so that it uses a `for` loop. This will make the code much more maintainable and extendable.

There is a video at the start of the walkthrough - show the first three minutes or so. Make sure not to go beyond those three minutes, but note that participants can watch the full video later if they desire.

## Self-Paced Work: Challenges
There are some [instructions](BabelUpdates.md) for extending the project from the code-along activity. At the end, if the participants complete all of the challenge portions, the project should look [something like this](http://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/BabelComplete). There are also some [additional challenges](ForLoopChallenges.md).
