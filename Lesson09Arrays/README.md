# Lesson 9: Arrays
Introduce [arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) as a way to store list data.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to:

- Create arrays
- Access array elements by index
- Loop through arrays

## Warm-Up: Top Five Restaurants
Have the participants complete the warm-up activity by following [the instructions](WarmUp.md). This is mainly meant as a diversion for fun; it can lend itself to an interesting discussion. Advanced participants can also look at the code that builds the site.

## Basic Presentation: Introduction to Arrays
The [basic presentation](IntroductionToArrays.pptx) introduces the concept of arrays, explains their importance, and shows the JavaScript syntax. It also covers looping through arrays, and the usefulness of arrays for DOM interaction.

## Code-Along: Movie Watchlist
Follow the [instructions](WatchlistCodeAlong.md) to build up a website meant to track movies on a watchlist.

## Advanced Presentation: More Ways to Array
The [advanced presentation](MoreWaysToArrays.pptx) introduces array methods like `filter` and `map`, as well as different syntaxes like [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) and [spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax).

## Self-Paced Work: Challenges
There are some additional [challenges](ArraysChallenges.md), some of which are basic, and some of which are advanced.
