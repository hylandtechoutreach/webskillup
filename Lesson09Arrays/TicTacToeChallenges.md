## Option One: A.I. Player
Currently, the only option is to play with two human players (or one human playing against themselves). Add the ability for a "computer" player to face off against a human player.

To start, the A.I. player can simply choose a random open spot on the board to claim. After that, some strategy can be added to make the computer into a much more worthy opponent. Tic-Tac-Toe is a [solved game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game), so it is possible to make the computer literally unbeatable.

## Option Two: Tic-Tac-Toe-Ta
Update the game so that it is a `4`x`4` grid instead of a `3`x`3` grid. It may be helpful to update the win conditions and game state storage to be more generalized.

### BONUS: Any Grid Size
Allow the _user_ to determine the size of the grid.
