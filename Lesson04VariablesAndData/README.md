# Lesson 4: Variables & Data
This lesson introduces variables, data types, and `prompt`.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to:

- Recognize strings and numbers
- Store data in variables
- Use data from variables
- Ask questions with `prompt`

## Self-Paced Reading
Instruct participants to read through the [Variables, Data Types, and `prompt`](VariablesDataPromptGuide.md) guide. This should familiarize them with the concepts needed for the lesson. Advanced students can read through the [in-depth further reading](FurtherReading.md).

## Code-Along: Mad Libs
Walk through the [instructions](MadLibsCodeAlong.md) with the participants.

## Self-Paced Work: Challenges
Introduce the [challenges](VariablesChallenges.md), and assist the participants as they work through them.

## Formative Assessment: Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz game](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/645d479c95a16ca350aba053). Note that it also includes some trivia just for fun.
