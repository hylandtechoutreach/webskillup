## Mad Libs Updates
Update the Mad Libs by adding another sentence, or changing the story entirely! It can be anything. Come up with a totally original story, pull from a Wikipedia article, or find another public domain piece of text.

As the story continues, though, it may become a little difficult to handle... luckily, **template strings** help a lot!

### Template Strings
Learn how to use [template literals](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_templates.asp) to make interpolation easier. Then, update the mad libs code so that is uses template literals instead of a bunch of `+` operations.
