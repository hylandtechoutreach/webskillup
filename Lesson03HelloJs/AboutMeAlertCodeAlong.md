# Code-Along: About Me Alert
In this activity, make your [About Me](../Lesson02Css/AboutMeStylesCodeAlong.md) website display a pop-up when the user arrives.

## Make a New File
To start, you must create a new JavaScript file. For this activity, name it **script.js**.

## Add Code to the File
The next step is to add some code to the new file. Open it up for editing, and then add an `alert` statement that says whatever you'd like. It should look something like this:

```js
alert("hello world");
```

>_Side-note: [Hello World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) is often the first program a developer writes in a new language!_

## Include the File
For the code to actually run, the file must be included. Open up the **index.html** file for editing, and add the `<script>` element to the bottom of the `<body></body>`. It should look something like this:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

## Conclusion
That's it, you are now a JavaScript developer! This activity was designed to be short and sweet, but it's just scratching the surface.
