# Web Skillup
This program is designed to prepare Sales Engineers to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each lesson should have a **basic** approach, as well as an **advanced** approach. The **basic** approach will cover the topic for complete beginners. The **advanced** approach will dive into more advanced features of the topic.

## Potential Schedule
This program is designed to be very flexible, but it may be helpful to have some point of reference for the timing of everything. The hope is to make it through all the content by the end, so these blocks can be a good measure for overall pace.
