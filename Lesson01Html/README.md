# Lesson 1: HTML
This lesson introduces HTML through a code-along activity, and allows participants to explore many facets of the language.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, participants will be able to:

- Create a variety of HTML elements, including `input`s and `div`s
- Understand how HTML elements render from code
- Use attributes
- Explain parent-child relationships

## Code-Along: About Me
Walk through the [code-along instructions](AboutMeCodeAlong.md) with the participants, making sure to introduce the concepts throughout. This should be quick enough that even the advanced participants can keep pace.

Also, as part of this, talk a bit more about Replit, and the expectations for code-along activities.

## Self-Paced Work: About Me Updates
Let participants complete the [self-paced work](AboutMeSelfPacedWork.md) to update their sites.

## Additional Resources
Advanced participants can explore the [additional resources](Advanced.md), and try to use that knowledge to update their sites.
