# Working with APIs
In almost any real-world software application, there will be some form of [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). They can be used to work with _real data_ across the web, and they open up several possibilities for websites. Review some of the resources in the **Background** section, or feel free to jump right into the activities/examples.

## Background
Working with APIs in JavaScript requires familiarity quite a few additional topics:

- [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)
  - [Query Parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)
- [JavaScript Promises](https://javascript.info/promise-basics)
- [`async` / `await`](https://javascript.info/async-await)
- [`try` / `catch`](https://javascript.info/try-catch)
- [`fetch`](https://javascript.info/fetch)

It will not be necessary to fully grasp the intricacies of these topics, but know that they make it possible to use APIs in JavaScript.

## Introductory Activity: Dog Fetcher
Follow the [guided activity instructions](DogFetcherGuidedActivity.md) to practice using an API. There are some [challenges](DogFetcherUpdates.md) as well.

_Note: these activities were originally designed for children, so please excuse any overly-infantile phrasing_

## More Examples
There are a _ton_ of [public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) you can use to practice working with external data sources. Here are some examples:

- [Trivia](ApiExamples/Trivia.md)
- [Weather](ApiExamples/Weather.md)
- [Macro Randomizer](ApiExamples/MacroRandomizer.md)
- [Color Schemes](ApiExamples/ColorSchemes.md)
- [TV Characters](ApiExamples/TvCharacters.md)
