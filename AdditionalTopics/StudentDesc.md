# Additional Topics
These topics should expand your knowledge of JavaScript and the world of web development. Feel free to dig through them at your own pace, but don't hesitate to leverage the expertise of your instructors!

## Working with APIs
APIs are an incredibly important aspect of modern full-stack web development. Check out [this page](Apis.md) to learn more.

## Classes
In computer science, [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is a powerful paradigm for creating large-scale applications. In JavaScript, classes make it possible to work in this model.

## Components
With almost any form of enterprise software application development, it is important to create encapsulated pieces of functionality that are modular, reusable, extendable, and scalable. There are a number of different ways to adhere to this component-based architecture, and at the core of all of them is the ability to work with small parts that come together to build a full software product.

It is important to both **create** and **utilize** these components effectively. You may be working with a bunch of existing components, and have to put them all together in a nice way; you may have to create custom components to satisfy particular requirements. Either way, understanding the big picture and the philosophy behind it can help immensely with solution development.

### Libraries & Frameworks
In the web world, there are several frameworks that allow developers to build their own reusable components.

- [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) is actually built right into the web, and serves as the basis of some other frameworks
  - [Tutorial](https://javascript.info/webcomponents-intro)
- [Lit](https://lit.dev/) uses web components to power a simple but full-featured library
  - [Tutorial](https://lit.dev/tutorials/intro-to-lit/)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) is an incredibly popular framework that integrates several complex libraries
  - [Tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app)
- [React](https://react.dev/) is another framework that is a little simpler than Angular, but still powerful
  - [Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn)

## TypeScript
In your exploration of frameworks, you may come across this thing called [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). TypeScript is basically the same as JavaScript, with one distinction: it is **strongly typed** (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing) for more information on this). This can make the development process (especially debugging) much easier, mostly because it will yell at you more. It will require you to understand the code you write more deeply, which can be challenging, but overall, it makes software much more maintainable and robust. Check out one of these to learn more:
